I approached this project by first understanding the requirements for a BMI calculator. Then, I created a simple HTML structure to capture user input for weight and height. Next, I wrote JavaScript code to calculate the BMI based on the input values and display the result. I also included logic to determine the weight range based on the calculated BMI.

How to navigate this project:

The project consists of three main files: index.html, styles.css, and app.js.

index.html contains the structure of the BMI calculator interface.
styles.css contains the styling for the interface elements.
app.js contains the JavaScript code for calculating the BMI and updating the interface with the result.
The screenshot of how the project looks like is found within the files titled "Project Picture"

Why I built the project this way:

I chose to keep the project simple and focused on functionality. The HTML provides a clear structure for user input and result display. The CSS styles the interface to make it visually appealing and easy to use. The JavaScript code calculates the BMI and updates the interface dynamically, providing instant feedback to the user

I will continue to add to the visuals.
